Hi, I work on swarm systems. Problem about those systems is that none of the exisitng frontend/backend really fit my needs. 
So I am making an extremly simple simulator interface with THREE.JS. 

just follow up the installation manual on threejs Instalaltion Manual from it's website.
Than `Npx vite`, it should fire up in your local host.

TO DO:
- Clickable Drones
- Instancing multiple drones
- Add/Remove Drones
- for POC control a drone with wasd keys.
- Using python for backend(Drone simualator, controller, data logger, DB etc.)
